//placeholder for Classes and Objects lessons
//Class is a blueprint with attributes and functions describing data, but creates no objects itself when defined/created
//Objects are instances of a class, created using Classes as the blueprint

class City {
 
  // attribute
  int population;
 
// we'll explain 'public' later
public:
  // method
  void add_resident() {
    population++;
  }
 
};
